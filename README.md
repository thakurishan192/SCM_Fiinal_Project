## ABOUT PROJECT

This is a fun and engaging quiz application built using HTML

CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges users with general knowledge questions and provides immediate feedback on their choices.

Login Page: The user journey starts with a login page, ensuring a secure entry point. 

Interactive Questions: Once logged in, users are presented with a series of general knowledge questions. 

Real-time Feedback: As users select their answer options, the chosen option is dynamically highlighted. Green indicates a correct answer, while red signifies an incorrect selection. This immediate feedback helps users learn and improve their knowledge.

This project showcases the power of combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It provides an engaging learning experience with its question format and immediate visual feedback.
